 # Coursera's Machine Learning Specialization
## This Specialization is about:

Designed in collabration with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online, this beginner friendly progrm will introduces ou to the fundamentals of machine learning and how to apply them to real world AI problems.

Andrew Ng, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, is the instructor of this Specializtion, He has been the key player in the advancement of AI at Standford University, Google Brain, Baidu and landing.AI

Over 4.8 million learners have taken Andrew's pioneering Machine Learning course since it launched in 2012. This 3-course Specialization is an updated version.

Modern machine learning is discussed, including supervised learning (multiple linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and decision trees), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems), and some of Silicon Valley's best practices on artificial intelligence and machine learning (evaluating models, taking a data-centric approach to improving performance, among others).

This new Machine Learning Specialization is ideal for those looking to break into AI or grow their careers in machine learning.
