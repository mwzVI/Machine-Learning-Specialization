# Advanced Learning Algorithms
## This Course is about:

During the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, the student will: Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow in order to perform multi-class classification; Apply best practices regarding machine learning development in order to ensure that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world; and Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods such as random forests and boosted trees.
